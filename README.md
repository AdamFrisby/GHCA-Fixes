GitHub Coding Agent constantly hitting a rate limit and dying, and you need to manually restart it?

This project is for you.

Automatically resumes failed tasks after a while, so you don't have to constantly manually do it yourself.

It _also_ forces Copilot to go back and check it's work against your original spec. Frequently it will do something like "Implement half your spec and tell you it is done." if you tell GHCA to look at the original issue - it'll often get a bit closer to truly done. This just forces it to do it three times which I find is frequent enough to get it to actually do what you asked it to in the first place.

Supplied entirely without testing or indications on whether this is a good idea. Just scratching a personal itch thanks to having to type '@copilot continue' more times than I can count this week...)
